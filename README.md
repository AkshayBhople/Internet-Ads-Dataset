Dataset Description
--------------------------------

This dataset represents a set of possible advertisements on Internet pages.
There are 1559 columns  & 3279 rows in the data.
Each row in the data represent one image which is tagged as Ad or non-Ad in the last column.
Column 0 to 1557 represent the actual numerical attributes of the images & last column represents weather the image is ad or not.
First three columns are continous which contain attribute like height,width,aratio and rest of the columns contain other numerical attributes of the 
 image which are encoded in binary format.
The dataset contains the missing values which are denoted in dataset by ' ? ' & it is about 28% of the total data in first three columns.


The task is to predict whether an image is an advertisement ("ad") or not ("nonad").
We have to classify the image into ad/nonad based on the attributes.
